 * Builds a distance matrix between nodes in two different graphs based on the
 * Euclidian distances between the nodes after layout. Distances are computed on
 * normalized coordinates (between 0 and 1) based on the graphs' visual bounds.
 * Nodes which are perfectly aligned have a distance of zero.
 * 
 * In accordance with the matrix representation, the first graph is called the column
 * graph, the second one is the row graph.
