/**
 * This Java component illustrates the use of the class AnimatedFloat.
 * 
 * The component shows two rectangles (a non-animated one and an animated one)
 * whose positions are updated each time the user clicks in the window. The rectangles
 * also appear and disappear when the mouse cursor enters/leaves the window.
 * 
 * This code illustrates how to:
 * - Declare and initialize animated floats
 * - Set/get the value of animated floats
 * - Set up the repaint mechanism
 * - Change the speed of animations
 * 
 * Please read the code attentively!
 *  
 * Additional things that are not illustrated here:
 * - Call x.endAnimation() to end an animation (equivalent to x.directSet(x.directGet())
 * - Call AnimationTimer.isRunning() to find out if floats are being animated.
 * - Call AnimatedFloat.setAnimationEnabled(false) to disable animations. Your animated
 *   floats will then behave as regular floats.
